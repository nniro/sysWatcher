System watcher project. Made as a generic event system, this project, fully
scriptable, permit to use custom triggers to either call a specific script or
send an email with specific content. The triggering events is totally the
responsibility of the plugin scripts, hence the coined term "generic" for the
project. sysWatcher.sh looks for sysWatcher.conf either in /etc or in the
directory where the script is currently. This configuration file needs to
contain at least 3 variables : email, eventDir and varDir. These 3 values are
mandatory since eventDir is the place where the script looks for the plugin
scripts, varDir contains among other, the timeout temporary files and email is
the default email which is used. The plugin scripts need to contain a certain
amount of mandatory functions to be fully functionnal. Details are fully laid
out (also for the sysWatcher.conf file) inside sysWatcher.sh.

The installation process is necessary due to dependency on in-house scripts
which provide functions useful for plugins and the main script alike.
Functions facilitating date and time malipulation are provided, among others.

Due to compatibility reasons, only bash and zsh are supported, dash does not
have enough features to work correctly. To a certain extent (though not
tested) ksh could also work.

It is necessary to put sysWatcher.sh in a cron job (or similar), this will
make sysWatcher run as often or as little as necessary for your need.

It would be quite trivial to run sysWatcher as a standalone daemon, but that
would probably be less useful than in a cron job.
